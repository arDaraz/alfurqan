# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the label strings the skills write in this repo's issue tracker.

| Canonical role    | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`    | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`      | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human` | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`         | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

**Prerequisite:** of these five, only `wontfix` exists in `arDaraz/alfurqan` today (checked 2026-08-21). `gh` rejects a command that names a label the repo does not have, so create the other four once before the first triage run:

```bash
gh label create needs-triage --description "Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue"
gh label create needs-info --description "Waiting on reporter for more information"
gh label create ready-for-agent --description "Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent"
gh label create ready-for-human --description "Requires human implementation"
```

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.
